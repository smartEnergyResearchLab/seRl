# seRl

R package to support analysis of SERL data, particularly on the SERL AWS platform.

Ideally you would just clone, build & install on the AWS platform but currently we are unable to synch this repo with a mirror inside the AWS. We're working on it.

# Notes

 * Using the [SERL AWS](notes/aws.md)
